## Build Requirements

- **Cross-compiler**: x86_64-elf-gcc or clang 
- **Build system**: CMake + GNU Make
- **ISO creation**: xorriso
- **Emulation**: QEMU with x86_64 support
- **Bootloader**: Limine (automatically downloaded)

### macOS Setup
```bash
# Install cross-compiler toolchain
brew install x86_64-elf-gcc
brew install cmake
brew install xorriso
brew install qemu
```

## Building and Running

```bash
# Build the kernel and create ISO
make clean && make

# Run in QEMU
make qemu

# Run with debug output
make qemu-debug

# Run with full logging
make qemu-log
```

## Architecture

### Memory Layout
- **Kernel VA**: `0xffffffff80000000` - `0xffffffff9fffffff` (Higher-half kernel)
- **Kernel heap**: `0xffffffffA0000000` - `0xffffffffBfffffff`
- **Physical mapping**: `0xffffffffC0000000` - `0xffffffffDfffffff` (HHDM)  
- **User code**: `0x10000` (Low canonical addresses, isolated PML4)
- **User stack**: `0x800000-0x802000` (8KB stack with guard pages)

### Enhanced Boot Sequence
1. **UEFI firmware** loads Limine bootloader from ISO
2. **Limine** loads kernel ELF and sets up initial 4-level paging
3. **Kernel entry** (`start.S`) initializes x86-64 long mode environment
4. **Page table setup** - Kernel writable sections with proper R/W/X permissions
5. **GDT/TSS initialization** - Segment descriptors for user/kernel separation
6. **IDT initialization** - Per-vector exception handlers with fault analysis
7. **PMM initialization** - Physical memory management with statistics
8. **VMM initialization** - Virtual memory, heap, and page table isolation
9. **Kernel PML4 template** - Template for user address space creation
10. **Scheduler initialization** - Threading infrastructure and context switching
11. **Syscall initialization** - SYSCALL/SYSRET MSRs and dispatch framework
12. **User mode test** - Create isolated user process and execute syscalls
13. **System ready** - All major components operational

```bash
# Run with GDB support
make qemu-debug
# In another terminal:
gdb build/kernel/kernel.elf
(gdb) target remote :1234
(gdb) continue
```

### Serial Logging
All kernel output goes to serial port (COM1), visible in QEMU console when using `-serial stdio`.
